# Plasmate

The browser engine for AI agents. HTML in, Semantic Object Model out.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Run
./target/release/plasmate fetch https://example.com

# MCP mode (for Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
./target/release/plasmate mcp
```

## Architecture

- `src/main.rs` - CLI entry point (Clap)
- `src/network/` - HTTP fetch with H1/H2 fallback, custom headers
- `src/som/` - Semantic Object Model compiler (HTML to structured JSON)
- `src/cdp/` - Chrome DevTools Protocol server
- `src/awp/` - Agent Web Protocol handler
- `src/bench/` - Benchmarking runner
- `src/js/` - V8 JavaScript execution engine
- `website/` - plasmate.app homepage
- `integrations/` - Framework adapters (Vercel AI, LangChain, browser-use)

## Key Commands

- `plasmate fetch <url>` - Fetch URL, output SOM JSON
- `plasmate fetch <url> --text` - Extract readable text only
- `plasmate fetch <url> -H "Authorization: Bearer ..."` - Fetch with custom headers
- `plasmate serve` - Start CDP server
- `plasmate mcp` - Start MCP server (stdio)
- `plasmate bench <url>` - Run benchmarks

## Testing

```bash
cargo test
cargo check
```

## Version

Version is derived from `Cargo.toml` via `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`. Do not hardcode version strings.

## Running State

### 2026-05-05 - Plasmate Improvements Automation

- Git sync: attempted `git fetch --prune origin`, but the sandbox still cannot
  write shared worktree metadata at
  `/Users/steve/Git/plasmate/.git/worktrees/plasmate7/FETCH_HEAD`. `gh` is
  installed, but the configured token for `dbhurley` is invalid, so push/merge
  cannot complete from this environment.
- Market direction: Playwright MCP structured accessibility snapshots,
  Browserbase/Stagehand action caching, and Firecrawl MCP/browser sessions
  continue to validate Plasmate's sticky wedge: local, reusable, full-tree SOM
  snapshots with stable agent-facing contracts.
- Ecosystem state: the project spans Rust core protocols, Python/Node/Go SDKs,
  Browser Use, LangChain, Vercel AI, SOM parser packages, plugin examples,
  smoke tests, generated website docs, comparison pages, and marketing assets.
  This is a distribution advantage, but schema and fixture conformance now need
  to be treated as roadmap work.
- Code changes: cache prefetch extraction now walks nested and shadow-root SOM
  elements, dedupes HTTP(S) URLs, and ignores non-navigation schemes; cache URL
  normalization preserves case-sensitive paths; MCP text/link extraction now
  includes shadow-root content.
- Docs changes: updated the PRD and roadmap with the current market read,
  ecosystem surface risk, reasons for the changes, and next steps around
  selector-aware cache, trace export, ARIA/SaaS parity, and shadow-DOM
  conformance.
- Verification: focused tests passed with the shared target cache:
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/steve/Git/plasmate/target cargo test cache::store -- --nocapture`
  and
  `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/Users/steve/Git/plasmate/target cargo test mcp::tools::tests -- --nocapture`.
  Direct tests in the worktree target failed because `rusty_v8` attempted to
  download its prebuilt archive and DNS/network is blocked.

### 2026-05-04 - Plasmate Improvements Automation

- Git sync: attempted `git fetch --prune origin`, but the sandbox could not write shared worktree metadata at `/Users/steve/Git/plasmate/.git/worktrees/plasmate6/FETCH_HEAD`. Local detached HEAD matched the tracked `origin/master` snapshot available in this worktree.
- Market direction: Playwright MCP is making structured accessibility snapshots a baseline, Firecrawl is expanding MCP scraping/browser sessions, and Browserbase/Stagehand is using action caching and observability as retention hooks. Plasmate should lean into local SOM snapshots, selector-aware caching, and ecosystem conformance.
- Code changes: selector filtering now trims whitespace and supports documented `#region-id` selection; common ARIA widgets map to actionable SOM roles; hidden inline-style stripping handles casing and whitespace variants.
- Docs changes: added PRD direction, updated roadmap priorities, and corrected README tool count/Rust version drift.
- Next focus: selector-aware SOM cache entries, MCP/AWP trace export, and ARIA-heavy SaaS conformance fixtures.

## Claude Code Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Bias toward caution over speed.

### Think Before Coding
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — do not pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what is confusing. Ask.

### Simplicity First
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

### Surgical Changes
- Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Do not refactor things that are not broken.
- Match existing style, even if you would do it differently.
- Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Goal-Driven Execution
- Transform tasks into verifiable goals with success criteria.
- For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification checkpoints.
- Strong success criteria enable independent work. Weak criteria require constant clarification.
